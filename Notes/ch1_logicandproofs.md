# Logic and Proofs

### Notes
* The main goal of math is to establish mathematical truths.
* A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements but is called molecular if it can.
* Statements must be boolean values.
* A sentence with a variable where the value is not given is not a statement.
## Challenges
#### Challenge 1 
Solution is not P or Q

|  p  |  q  |  p and q  |  p or q  |  p => q  |  not p or q  |
|-----|-----|-----------|----------|----------|--------------|
|  1  |  1  |     1     |    1     |    1     |      1       |
|  1  |  0  |     0     |    1     |    0     |      0       |
|  0  |  1  |     0     |    1     |    1     |      1       |
|  0  |  0  |     0     |    0     |    1     |      1       |

### Definitions

* premise: All statements but the last in an argument
* conclusion: The last statement in an argument
* argument: A sequence of statements
* theorem: A name for a general mathematical truth
* proposition: A name for a general mathematical truth
* proof: A valid argument to prove a mathematical truth
* statement: A declaritive sentence which is either true or false. A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called molecular.
* quantifier: A symbol indicating the scope of the predicate
* predicate: A statement containing variables
* logical connective: Another term for Logic gates in mathematics
* binary connective: A logical connective that connects two statements
* unary connective: A logical connective that applies to a single statment
* truth value: A value indicating whether the statement is true or false
* propositional variables: Capital letters that act as variables for prepositions and can only be True or False
* conjunction: The logical connective 'and' displayed as ^ used to connect two statements
* disjunction: The logical connective 'or' displayed as ⋁ used to connect two statments
* implication: The logical connective 'if P then Q' which is also equal to not P or Q and displayed as P → Q
* conditional: The logical connective 'if P then Q' which is also equal to not P or Q and displayed as P → Q
* biconditional: A statement formed where 'P, if and only if Q' displayed as P ↔ Q
* negation: A statement where the truth value of a statement is swaped, read as 'not P' and displayed as ¬P
* truth conditions: The outcome truth value of a statement after using logical connectives
