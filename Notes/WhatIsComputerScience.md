# What Is Computer Science

## Summarization
Computer science is often though to be a science or engineering discipline. However, the article argues that it is more aligned with philosophy, specifically log. This article demonstrated the following points:

* Philosophical Practices: Unlike traditional science, where theories are validated by observation, CS often deals with virtual realities and models created from human beliefs on solving problems.

* Historical examples: In the 1950s, software performance was judged based on speed and memory usage. Analytical methods were used to measure and predict performance, but these were specific to particular programs and computers.

* Current research trends: Most Computer Science research now prioritizes theoretical and logical approaches over empirical data, making it more philosophical in nature.

* Present day events: There was a paper explaining why open-source software is less secure than proprietary software, using flawless and logical arguements. However more security flaws were discovered in Microsoft's software than open-source software. The paper made these arguements without any data, only logical assumptions

* Aristotles philosphy: Mathematicians don’t need hypotheses. They only need to state their assumptions and use logic to derive results. However, as seen above, unless there’s a rigorous way to test an assumption’s validity, it’s a dangerous approach to apply to the real world. These assumptions led Aristotle to conclude the heart was the center of consciousness.

In conclusion, the author argues that acknowledging CS as a philosophical discipline rather than strictly a science or engineering field could benefit both education and practice in the field. They advocate for using appropriate tools and recognizing the strengths and limitations of each discipline. Furthermore, the author points out potential risks to skipping empirical data and sticking with assumptions 

## Why did we read this?
We most likely read this because our teacher wanted to stimulate our  curiosity, encourage critical thinking, and provide a richer context for understanding the complexities of computer science.
