# What Is Computer Science

## Summarization
Computer science is often though to be a science or engineering discipline. However, the article argues that it is more aligned with philosophy, specifically log. This article demonstrated the following points:

* Philosophical Practices: Unlike traditional science, where theories are validated by observation, CS often deals with virtual realities and models created from human beliefs on solving problems.

* Historical examples: In the 1950s, software performance was judged based on speed and memory usage. Analytical methods were used to measure and predict performance, but these were specific to particular programs and computers.

* Current research trends: Most Computer Science research now prioritizes theoretical and logical approaches over empirical data, making it more philosophical in nature.

* Present day events: There was a paper explaining why open-source software is less secure than proprietary software, using flawless and logical arguements. However more security flaws were discovered in Microsoft's software than open-source software. The paper made these arguements without any data, only logical assumptions

* Aristotles philosphy: Mathematicians don’t need hypotheses. They only need to state their assumptions and use logic to derive results. However, as seen above, unless there’s a rigorous way to test an assumption’s validity, it’s a dangerous approach to apply to the real world. These assumptions led Aristotle to conclude the heart was the center of consciousness.
