# Chapter 1.2 Notes

- **Definition of Implication:** An implication (or conditional) is a statement of the form 𝑃 → 𝑄, where 𝑃 is the hypothesis (or antecedent) and 𝑄 is the conclusion (or consequent). An implication is true if 𝑃 is false or 𝑄 is true (or both), and false otherwise.

- **Importance of Implications:** Implications are significant in mathematics and logic because they are used to make general claims and reason about various mathematical objects.

*** Vocab

- **Conditional**: Also known as an Implication P → Q
- **Converse**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite. Using the above defined implication it would be Q → P
- **Contrapositive**: Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite and the negation. Using the above defined implication it would be -Q → -P
- **Inverse**: Regarding a certain implication, it takes the negation . Using the above defined implication it would be -P → -Q
