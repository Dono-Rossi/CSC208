# Chapter 1.2 Notes

- **Definition of Implication:** An implication (or conditional) is a statement of the form 𝑃 → 𝑄, where 𝑃 is the hypothesis (or antecedent) and 𝑄 is the conclusion (or consequent). An implication is true if 𝑃 is false or 𝑄 is true (or both), and false otherwise.

- **Importance of Implications:** Implications are significant in mathematics and logic because they are used to make general claims and reason about various mathematical objects.
