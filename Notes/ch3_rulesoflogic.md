# Rules of Logic

## Notes
- **Truth Tables**
	- Truth tables are used to explore the relationships between different logical statements.
	- They help determine whether statements are logically equivalent.
	- A truth table lists all possible combinations of truth values for a set of statements and their resulting truth values.
- **Logical Equivalence**
	- Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.
	- Logical equivalence allows us to simplify complex logical statements.
- **Deduction Rules**
	- Deduction rules are used to derive conclusions from premises in a logically valid manner.
	- Examples include Modus Ponens (if 𝑃 → 𝑄 and 𝑃 are true, then 𝑄 must be true) and Modus Tollens (if 𝑃 → 𝑄 and ¬𝑄 are true, then ¬𝑃 must be true).
