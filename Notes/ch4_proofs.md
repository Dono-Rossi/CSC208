# Proofs

## What are proofs?
### A proof is a logical argument that demonstrates the truth of a given statement or theorem. It's a fundamental aspect of mathematics that involves using a sequence of logical steps, based on axioms, definitions, and previously established results, to show that a particular proposition is true.

## Types of proofs
There are three styles of proof: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. 
- Direct Proof: Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. You look at the definitions, carefully explain and unpack their meaning, until you see that the conclusion is true. This is typically shown with 𝑃 → 𝑄.

- Proof by Contrapositive: An implication of 𝑃 → 𝑄 is logically euivalent to its contrapositive of ¬Q → ¬P. As there are many statements which are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can be easily proved. This is similar to a direct proof but you assume ¬Q, explain, and arrive at ¬P. 

- Proof by Contradition: If a conclusion to an arguement is false, that aeither means that the arguement is faulty or an assumption must be false. A proof by constradiction uses this to lead to a false conclusion and prove that the assumption was false. You assume ¬P, and analysize, but that is a contradiction, so P must be true.

## Start - End

### Direct
- Start: Assume P
- End: Therefore Q
### Contrapositive
- Start: Assume ¬Q
- End: Conclude ¬P
### Contradiction
- Start: Assume ¬(𝑃 → 𝑄)
- End: ...which is a contradiction
