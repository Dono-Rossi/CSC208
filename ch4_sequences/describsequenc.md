# Question One
## For the sequence with the closed formula $a_n = n^2 + 6n+3$ , find the term $a_8$

- This is a particularly straightforward question as the problem provides a closed formula for the sequence, meaning that we can just plug 8 into the formula.
- By doing this we get $a_8 = (8)^2 + 6(8) + 3$

This simplifies to $115$ , meaning that $a_8 = 115$
