#### dis·crete / dis’krët.
### *Adjective:* Individually separate and distinct.
### *Synonyms:* Separate - Detached - Distinct - Abstract.

## Summarization

* Discrete mathematics is used in various fields such as computer science, cryptography, and network theory, making it an essential area of study for solving practical problems.

### Key Concepts



## Questions

* ### What is discrete math?
	Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete; separate, distinct, and not continuous. Objects like integers, graphs, and logical statements. Unlike continuous mathematics, which deals with real numbers and calculus, discrete mathematics focuses on countable, distinct elements.
* ### What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
	1. Combinatorics: The theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways.

	2. Sequences: An ordered list of elements, typically numbers (whole numbers). Can be used to show the number of operations grows with the input size. 

	3. Symbolic logic: Each statement can have a value of True or False. Must understand the structure of the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements interact to determine the truth value of the whole statement.

	4. Graph Theory: can use a graph to represent which elements of a set are related to each other.

* ### What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.
Discrete structures are mathematical are fundamental concepts in math, and are used as objects to represent parts of the problem being solved. They consist of distinct and separate elements, as opposed to continuous structures. Examples of these listed in the chapter are sets, functions, sequences, relations, and graphs.

	1. Sets: A collection of distinct objects, often referred to as elements or members. For example, the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, ...}. Furthermore, a set is determined by its membership, or in other words by the elements it contains and not by any other characteristics.

	2. Functions: A special type of relation where each input has a unique output. Functions map elements from one set to another in a way known as the *image* . It has a domain (set of all inputs) and a codomain (set of all allowable outputs), with the range being the set of all actual outputs or images from the domain.

	3. Sequences: An ordered list of elements. Can be finite or infinite, and each term is defined by its position in the sequence.

	4. Relations: Describe the relationships between elements of sets. For example, a relation can define pairs of elements that are related in some way. These relations have properties like reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity, which help us understand them better.

	5. Graphs: Consist of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (lines). Used to model relationships and structures in various fields, like computer networks or social networks.
