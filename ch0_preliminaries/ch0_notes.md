## Summarization

* Discrete mathematics is used in various fields such as computer science, cryptography, and network theory, making it an essential area of study for solving practical problems.

### Key Concepts



## Questions

* ### What is discrete math?
	Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete; separate, distinct, and not continuous. Objects like integers, graphs, and logical statements. Unlike continuous mathematics, which deals with real numbers and calculus, discrete mathematics focuses on countable, distinct elements.
* ### What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
	1. Combinatorics: The theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways.
	2. Sequences: An ordered list of elements, typically numbers (whole numbers). Can be used to show the number of operations grows with the input size. 
	3. Symbolic logic: Each statement can have a value of True or False. Must understand the structure of the statements, and how the truth values of the parts of the statements interact to determine the truth value of the whole statement.
	4. Graph Theory: can use a graph to represent which elements of a set are related to each other.
