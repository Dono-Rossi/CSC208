# Question Eight
## Consider functions given the domain $f:{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}$ and the range ${0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}$

### Strictly Increasing functions
- A function f is strictly increasing if a < b implies $f(a)$ < $f(b)$. This means we must assign values to $f(1)$ through $f(7)$ in increasing order.
- We select 7 distinct values from ${0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}$, meaning we are choosing 7 elements from a set of 11.
The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:
#### $C(11,7)$ $=$ $\frac{11!}{(11-7)!7!}$ $=$ $\frac{11!}{7!4!}$ 
- Ultimately giving us 330 strictly increasing functions.

### Non-Decreasing Function
