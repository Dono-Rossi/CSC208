# Question Five
## An anagram of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of “troublemakings” are there?

Because an anagram is just a rearrangement of all the letters in a word, in this case, we are arranging *n* distinct objects with the number of different arrangements (permutations) given by *n*!.

- The word "troublemakings" has 14 letters: T, R, O, U, B, L, E, M, A, K, I, N, G, S. All of these letters are distinct.

- **Permutation Formula:** Because there are 14 distinct letters, the number of different anagrams can be found through:
``` 14! = 14 x 13 x 12 x ... x 1 ```

This gives us an answer of $8.71782912 \times ($10^2$)$ or 87,178,291,200.
