# Question #7:
## How many positive integers less than 850 are multiples of 9, 5, or 2? Use th Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion.

Using the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion, specifically the version with 3 seperate sets, we have $|A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$. With the number of multiples of 9 being $|A|$, the number of multiples of 5 being $|B|$, and number of multiples of 2 being $|C|$.

To find the seperate portions of the equation, we divide 849 (as it says less than 850) by the number 9, 5, 2, 45, 10, 18, and 90 to get: 94 ($|A|$), 169 ($|B|$), 424 ($|C|$), 18 ($|A \cap B|$), 84 ($|B \cap C|$), 47 ($|A \cap C|$), and 9, ($|A \cap B \cap C|$).
<br />Plugging these values into the formula gives you **547**.
